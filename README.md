# Simple Shell

### Intro
This repository is a ALX Project. The project consisted in writing a shell like Unix shell, in **C**, using a limited number of standard library functions, So Instead we used our own functions.

The goal in this project was to make us understand how a shell works. To single out some items: what is the *environment*, the difference between *functions* and *system calls*, how to create *processes* using `execve`...
